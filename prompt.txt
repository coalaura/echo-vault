- Prefer short, searchable tags (1-3 words). Use lowercase.
- Include visible text snippets only if clearly readable.
- Accuracy over quantity: never guess. If you're not confident, leave it out.
- For tags: prefer specific observable things over generic terms. Avoid filler like "view", "display", "interface", "snapshot".
- No personally identifying guesses.
